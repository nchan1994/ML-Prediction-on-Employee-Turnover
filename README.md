# Employee Turnover ML Analysis

In this project, it focuses on a real life business problem that every HR personnel and company would face, employee turnover. The data was provided by a multi-national company for strictly to be used for learning purposes, with all personally identifying information removed or edited for the purposes of this project.   At the end of the project, I used Random Forests and Decision Trees to design an algorithm to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company based on certain characteristics and features. 

# Business Problem

Turnover can cost a company lots of money. On average, it cost a company around 2-3 times the employee's monthly salary to replace that employee. As such, it is of HR's objective to reduce turnover, or reduce the intention of employee's wanting to resign.

# Solution and Direction

With the data collected on each employee, we can use Machine Learning algorithms to analyse and explore the commonalities between those who choose to stay or leave the company. In this direction, Random Forest and Decision trees are explored. Further elaboration on the approach is provided in the notebook. Data is also provided as a csv.

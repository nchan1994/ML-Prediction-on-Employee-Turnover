# employee_turnover
In this project, it focuses on a real life business problem that every HR personnel and company would face, employee turnover. The data was provided by a multi-national company for strictly to be used for learning purposes, with all personally identifying information removed or edited for the purposes of this project.   At the end of the project, I used Random Forests and Decision Trees to design an algorithm to predict the likelihood of an employee leaving the company based on certain characteristics and features.
